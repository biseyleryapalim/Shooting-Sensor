# Arduino Shooting Game Sensors
This is the GitHub for the Shooting Game Sensors. Here you find the code to make it possible to program your Arduino for your Shooting targets.
Follow the instruction here: https://shootinggameblog.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/wireless-is-ready/ to build your 4 targets that needed. Then download the code here to program your 4 targets.

Here we collect the wireless/wired verson, if you only want wired version or wired, please remove that part.

We have now relsesed the Main code for the Shooting game. To use it you need the following librarys:

* Adafruit Terminal Printer: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library
* Adafruit RTC Lib: https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib
* SDFat library: https://github.com/greiman/SdFat
* nRF24L01 Library: https://github.com/nRF24/RF24

To use the system as it is you need:

* Terminal printer
* SD Card reader
* RTC Module
* NRF24L01 wireless transmittor
* 20x4 LCD

Please read on my blog on what parts you need and other stuff.

Keep updated here and report bugs, and modification to the code. It can be updated.
